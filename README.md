# 💫 Hi, I'm Noman
I build things that talk to each other.

**What I'm working with:**
- Java as primary language, Quarkus as framework and Maven as build tool
- PostgreSQL as relational database with Hibernate as ORM
- MongooseIM as XMPP server for instant messaging
- RabbitMQ for async messaging and event-driven communication
- Janus as WebRTC gateway for audio and video meetings
- Consul as service mesh and service discovery for microservices
- Firebase and APNS for push notifications on Android and iOS
- AWS Lambda for event-driven side service integrations

**What I'm currently studying:**
- Python and React to grow my full-stack skills

**What I really like?**

Working closely with frontend and mobile devs to turn ideas into real products.  
Seeing backend logic come alive in a smooth UI or a responsive mobile app is always satisfying.

Always learning. Always building. Always evolving.
